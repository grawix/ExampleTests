## Installation

**When attempting to import this project make sure you are using JAVA 8**

Import this project into your choice of IDE as a Maven project, it should pull in the dependencies but if this does not work for any reason, you can use maven command line to install them.

```bash
mvn clean install
```
This does require you to have maven installed on your file path though. A way around this is to use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) which comes bundled with maven. You will only require the free Community version.

## Usage

To validate everything is installed correctly, please run **UiRunner** and **ApiRunner** classes.
